>could help predict whether a patient will successfully respond to medication for a mood disorder

患者是否會對情緒障礙的藥物成功做出反應
Will they respond better to an antidepressant or to a mood stabilizer?

> may help distinguish certain mood disorders from others, such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder

透過患者的腦部掃描圖 確定是憂鬱症還是躁鬱症complex mood disorder

AI algorithm that classified mood disorders with 92.4 percent accuracy,

結論：have an objective measure of psychiatric illness through brain imaging that would make diagnosis faster, more effective and more consistent across healthcare providers.”

teach a computer to detect patients’ changes in emotion based on their speech

Our work is to identify biological markers that are physiological markers that are in speech.

過去通常是患者的家屬才會慢慢看出情緒轉變的時候，患者的speech出現改變，他們希望可以透過這樣speech中的生物性的識別(biological / physiological markers) 在發作前提出警示

, you realize things are starting to go down a bit, your device can give an alert and say, ‘Maybe you should talk to your doctor soon.’ (提出警示)
You can share this information with your care team, with your support network, so that you can be part of a team that's helping you stay healthy longer.

Provost said another challenge with AI for emotional recognition is cultural differences in the way different people express themselves. 
辨識情緒的AI的挑戰在於，來自不同的文化差異的人們，會用不同的表達自我情緒的方式(express themselves)

> Recent research efforts like the Twin studies have demonstrated a high heritability factor for the disorder, making genomics a viable alternative for detecting and treating bipolar disorder, in addition to conventional lengthy and costly post-symptom clinical diagnosis. Motivated by this study, leveraging several emerging deep learning algorithms, we design an end-to-end deep learning architecture (called DeepBipolar) to predict BD based on limited genomic data. 
 
作法：DeepBipolar adopts the Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) architecture that automatically extracts features from genotype information to predict the bipolar phenotype

> SAN FRANCISCO — Melvin G. McInnis, MD, Thomas B. and Nancy Upjohn Woodworth professor of bipolar disorder and depression and director of the Heinz C. Prechter Bipolar Research Program at University of Michigan, discussed analyzing speech segments from people with bipolar disorder to measure emotion.
> 
> Using speech segments from cellphones, researchers can measure the levels of activation and valance to determine features of speech associated with emotions. The hope is that this method can monitor variability of emotion over time among individuals with bipolar disorder.

## 報告內容
### 前言：What is Bipolar Disorder? 
> 簡介躁鬱症
> 

1) Bipolar disorder is a mental illness that results in **extreme mood shifts** known as mania and manic depression. Theses mood shifts occur in an alternating manner and they can create lots of problems in the patient’s life. 

躁症
1) Mania is a state of elevated mood in which the patient loses all inhibitions and feels emotionally high. They may be excited, extremely happy and full of energy. This state of mania can result in rash behavior like extreme spending, drug use, etc.

鬱症
1) Then mania is followed by manic depression which is a state of extreme sadness and depression. In this state, patients may feel hopelessness, loss of energy, too little or too much sleep, suicidal tendencies, etc. Then the cycle repeats and manic depression is followed by mania and so on.


影響
1) These continuous cycles can deeply affect a patient’s life and make it difficult to lead a normal life. Patients have trouble handling things that others take for granted like a steady job or college life, relationships, etc. 

2) These moods can change quickly, last for weeks or months, and be separated by long periods of time, sometimes years.

治療、檢測
1) While there is no cure for Bipolar disorder, the symptoms can be managed using different treatment options that are available. 

2) So an accurate way of diagnosing mood changes as they happen would be hugely useful for sufferers and health-care providers alike.
### 方法：How can Artificial Intelligence help in detecting Bipolar Disorder?

1) 兩種手機應用
2) Venet Osmani at the Center for Research and Telecommunication Experimentation for Networked Communities (CREATE-NET) in Trento, Italy.  // the behavior patterns associated with bipolar disorder can be accurately detected by smartphone sensors which allow changes in mood to be spotted as they occur.//For example, the manic phase is often characterized by hyperactivity, which can be measured by an accelerometer and with a GPS device, by rapid speech, which can be monitored by speech analysis and by frequent conversations, which can be monitored through phone records.// By contrast, patients in the depressive stage of this condition demonstrate much changed levels of all these behaviors.// 實際試驗與數據結果![](https://i.imgur.com/5oeBHrw.png)
